# Language Translation

## Introduction

In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation. You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Getting the project files

The project files can be found in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the _language-translation_ folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.
