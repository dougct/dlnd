# Face Generation

## Introduction

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

## Getting the project files

The project files can be found in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the _face-generation_ folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.
